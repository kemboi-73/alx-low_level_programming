# Project 0x1C - C Makefiles

## Description
This project is focused on learning and implementing Makefiles, a build automation tool used for compiling and managing software projects. The project involves several tasks that gradually build upon each other, introducing you to the concepts of Makefiles, rules, variables, and compilation.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the concepts of make and Makefiles.
- Understand when, why, and how to use Makefiles in software development.
- Define rules and utilize them to automate compilation tasks.
- Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules.
- Implement common and useful rules for building software.
- Declare and utilize variables to enhance the flexibility of your Makefiles.

## Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Version of gcc:** 9.3.0
- **Version of make:** GNU Make 4.2.1
- All files should end with a newline.
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

## Tasks Overview
1. **0-Makefile: Create your first Makefile**
   - Create a basic Makefile to compile source files into an executable named "school".

2. **1-Makefile: Enhance your Makefile**
   - Build upon the previous Makefile by adding variables for the compiler and source files.

3. **2-Makefile: Create your first useful Makefile**
   - Expand the Makefile to include object files and improve the recompilation process.

4. **3-Makefile: Add cleaning rules**
   - Extend the Makefile to include rules for cleaning temporary and object files.

5. **4-Makefile: A complete Makefile**
   - Further enhance the Makefile with additional flags and rules for a complete build and clean process.

6. **5-island_perimeter.py: Island Perimeter**
   - Implement a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island described in a grid.

## Note
- Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.
- The project's goal is to teach you the concepts and skills related to Makefiles, so ensure you understand each step and complete the tasks on your own.
