Project 0x17 - C Doubly Linked Lists
This repository contains the solutions to the "0x17. C - Doubly linked lists" project, which is part of the ALX low-level programming curriculum. The project focuses on working with doubly linked lists in C.

Project Files
The project contains the following files:

lists.h: Header file containing the function prototypes and data structure definition.
0-print_dlistint.c: Function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list and returns the number of nodes.
1-dlistint_len.c: Function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
2-add_dnodeint.c: Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
3-add_dnodeint_end.c: Function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
4-free_dlistint.c: Function that frees a doubly linked list.
5-get_dnodeint.c: Function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
6-sum_dlistint.c: Function that returns the sum of all the data (n) in a doubly linked list.
7-insert_dnodeint.c: Function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
How to Use
To use the functions implemented in this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Include the lists.h header file in your C program: #include "lists.h".
Compile your program with the necessary source files.
Note: Make sure you have the required dependencies and a C compiler installed on your machine.
